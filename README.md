# SimpleSurvival Collectibles Website

## Overview
This project is a responsive website for a Minecraft server collectibles platform. It features various cosmetic items that players can explore and learn about. This platform is designed to allow players within a Minecraft community, to explore the variety of different event, legendary crate, mythic crate, and cosmetic items that have existed over the course of SimpleSurvival's lifespan.

### Features
- Administrative Dashboard: Allows administrators easy access to integrate any new items that may release, update any current items' information, or delete any items that may have been added by accident. This dashboard also allows administrators to easily assist users that may run into any issues with their accounts or the platform itself. This administrative dashboard is only accessible to accounts that hold the "Admin" or "SysAdmin" roles and account roles are verified through the platform's login authentication system.

- Public Display Tables: This feature allows players to directly view every item through the public webpages. Browsing is open to all users, but registered users gain access to in-depth features.

- Collection Lists: Registered users have been given a feature to directly create a list of the items they have ingame to provide an accurate representation of what items they have collected. This feature is tied to individual account's so users can update their collections without any interruption or invasion of privacy.

### Future additions
- Price Calculator: This is currently in the process of being developed, but this feature ultimately will list out a ranged value for each individual item on it's respective server. Users will be able to comment on these items, to allow others to view the price of these items as time moves forward.

- Collections List Sharing: This is currently in the process of being developed, but this feature will allow users to generate a temporary link for any registered and non-registered user to view, in a read-only mode, their collection list. This will allow users to share their list amongst peers, in a more productive format.

- Collections List Additions: TBD - Users will be given a feature that will allow them to select whichever items they choose and copy those items in a list format designed for Discord. This feature will be most useful to users when they are searching for specific items they don't have and want to advertise within the Simple Discord server that they are wanting to buy certain items.
